P8105 Homework 3
================
Heidi Lumish

## Problem 1

First we will load in the Instacart data from the p8105.datasets
library.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

#### Summary of the Instacart dataset

Next, we will summarize the dataset.

The Instacart dataset provides detailed information on grocery orders in
2017. The dataset has 15 variables, and it describes 1384617 products
from 131209 unique users. 59.86% products had been ordered by the user
in the past. The median time since the prior order for each customer was
15 (IQR 7, 30) days. There were 39123 unique products ordered from 134
different aisles.

### Specifics of the Instacart dataset

#### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

There are 134 aisles, and the most items are ordered from aisle. Using
the following code chunk, we can determine that the most items are
ordered from the aisle fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged
vegetables, yogurt, and packaged cheese.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    aisle_count = n()
  ) %>% 
  slice_max(aisle_count, n = 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 Ã— 2
    ##   aisle                      aisle_count
    ##   <chr>                            <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables                150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                    150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits       78493
    ## 4 yogurt                           55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                  41699

#### Plot showing the number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    aisle_count = n()
  ) %>% 
  filter(aisle_count >10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, aisle_count), y = aisle_count)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of products ordered per aisle",
    x = "Aisle name",
    y = "Number of products")
```
